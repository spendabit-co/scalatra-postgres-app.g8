To generate a skeleton webapp using this template, you'll first need [giter8](https://github.com/n8han/giter8). Then just do:

```
g8 spendabit/scalatra-postgres-app
```

And, assuming you have `sbt` installed and in your `PATH`, you can start up the development server like so...

```
$ sbt
> container:start
```
